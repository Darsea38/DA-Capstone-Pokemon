# Glossary
-- Metagame - Set of Pokemon commonly seen within a format, usually centralizing it. For instance, the VGC (Video Game Championship) format had a metagame of around 40 Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Tapu Fini, Tyranitar, Metagross, Cresselia, Kartana

Keep in mind that metagame only refers to the Pokemon used the most, whereas format englobes all the Pokemon available during a certain period of time. Despite this, people will oftentimes use format and metagame interchangeably - look out for the context!

-- STAB - Abbreviation for Same Type Attack Bonus, refers to the 50% damage increase of any given move used by a Pokemon that shares the same typing of the move.

For example, Tapu Lele gets a 50% boost when using Dazzling Gleam because both (Pokemon and Attack) are Fairy Type. This doesn't apply if the same Pokemon uses an attack that differs on typing, like Thunderbolt.

-- Movepool - Set of viable moves in competitive play that a Pokemon may learn

-- Testing - Playing with a team is not yet "completed" to find its weaknesses and weak points in order to improve it. Keep in mind that this is completely subjective.

-- Match-up - Describes the advantage (or disadvantage) of a given team against any other team or Pokemon. This is normally used to refer to how well you fare against them so you will hear expressions like "my team has a great match-up against Xerneas/Groudon teams" or "I had a terrible match-up against Nihilego", for example.

-- "Free" turn - Turn in which a player is allowed to switch, deal damage or set-up with its Pokemon at no cost because the opposing Pokemon do not set up nor attack, their attacks are not effective, or they switch out of the field.

-- Flinching - Effect of some moves, like Rock Slide, Icicle Crash, which makes the target Pokemon unable to attack during that turn.

While this is usually a secondary effect, the move Fake Out will always flinch its target if used on the first turn the user is on the field (otherwise, it won't have any effect).

-- Spamming - Using a move repeatedly on consecutive turns because there are no drawbacks on doing so. For example, a player's choice scarf landorus may use Rock Slide every turn as it moves the first of all Pokemon on the field and may flinch either foe.

-- Slot - This may refer to either moves (move slot) or Pokemon.

  Each team is made up of 6 Pokemon, each of them allocated on a slot. You will usually hear someone talk about "how hard it was to find the perfect final slot for a team" to refer to the 6th Pokemon.
  
  SImilarly, Pokemon can only learn 4 moves, and they are allocated on slots. The fourth slot of several Pokemon is used to include protecting moves that may prevent damage against the user and/or its partners, like Protect or Wide Guard.
  
-- Target - The target of an attack is the receiving end of it, that is, the one losing health, getting infatuated... Single-target moves can only hit the selected foe, whilst double target moves can hit both opponents.

-- Roll - Damage-dealing attacks do not inflict a specific, constant amount every time they are used (like, 40 HP or 26.5%). The amount of damage received by the target is randomly chosen by the game from a pre-set range (i.e, 120-137 HP or 38.6-44.7%)

-- Stall - Strategy that consists on defeating the opposing Pokemon thanks to residual damage dealt turn after turn.

  This also refers to Pokemon with great defensive base stats to tank attacks from the opponents while their HP is gradually reduced. Celesteela can wall lots of Pokemon due to its incredible defences and typing while can defeat them just using the Leech Seed + Protect + Leftovers combination.
